# Example Mutating Admission Webhook for Setting Pod HTTP Proxy

This work was cloned from [morvencao](https://github.com/morvencao/kube-mutating-webhook-tutorial)'s tutoral showing how to build and deploy a [MutatingAdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook-beta-in-19) that injects a set of env vars to allow dynamically setting HTTP Proxy in Pods versus using a [PodPreset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/podpreset/).

## Prerequisites

Kubernetes 1.9.0 or above with the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1` API enabled. Verify that by the following command:
```
kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
```
The result should be:
```
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
```

In addition, the `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` and `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` admission controllers should be added and listed in the correct order in the admission-control flag of kube-apiserver.

## Build

**NOTE:**  You only need to perform these steps if you are modifying the webhook or want to rebuild it.  Otherwise you can skip to Deploy and use the hosted image on Dockerhub to test.

1. Setup dep

   The repo uses [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) as the dependency management tool for its Go codebase. Install `dep` by the following command:

``` go
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
```

2. Build and push docker image

   Modify to push to your own registry :)

``` bash
./build
```

## Deploy

1. Create a signed cert/key pair and store it in a Kubernetes `secret` that will be consumed by the webhook.

``` bash
./deployment/webhook-create-signed-cert.sh \
    --service setenv-webhook-svc \
    --secret setenv-webhook-certs \
    --namespace default
```

2. Patch the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` Yaml to include the cert just generated by setting `caBundle` with correct signed cert from Kubernetes cluster

``` bash
cat deployment/mutatingwebhook.yaml | \
    deployment/webhook-patch-ca-bundle.sh > \
    deployment/mutatingwebhook-ca-bundle.yaml
```

3. Deploy resources

     **Note**:Change the configmap variables in the yaml to match your environment needs for proxy before creating the configmap.

```
kubectl create -f deployment/configmap.yaml
kubectl create -f deployment/deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f deployment/service.yaml
kubectl create -f deployment/mutatingwebhook-ca-bundle.yaml
```

## Verify

1. The setenv webhook should be running

``` bash
mg-imac:virtmerlin mglynn$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                         READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
setenv-webhook-deployment-69f77c8bb-m49zd    1/1       Running       0          16m
```

2. Deploy an app in the Kubernetes cluster, take `sleep` app as an example

``` yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sleep
spec:
  selector: 
    matchLabels:
      app: sleep
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sleep
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: sleep
        image: tutum/curl
        command: ["/bin/sleep","infinity"]
EOF
```

3. Verify Variables Have Been Set

``` bash 
mg-imac:virtmerlin mglynn$ POD=$(kubectl get pod | grep sleep | awk '{print$1}') && kubectl exec $POD -- env | grep HTTP
HTTP_PROXY=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.1.1:8080/
HTTPS_PROXY=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.0.1:8080/
KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_HTTPS=443
```
